# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning models. By leveraging a structured dataset of medical attributes, the project aims to provide a robust solution for early diagnosis and prevention of heart-related illnesses.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, which includes various medical indicators such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key features. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farzadnekouei/heart-disease-prediction/notebook).

### Key Features
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual.
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol levels.
- **Blood Pressure**: Resting blood pressure values.
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced.
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
- And more.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of key features.
   - Analyzing relationships between variables.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Trained various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate model performance.
   - Comparison of different models to identify the best-performing one.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of approximately **XX%** with the best model.
- Provided insights into key factors influencing heart disease risk.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
